## `BasicState.new()`

---

Creates a new state object. Accepts an optional `InitialState` parameter, for defining the state before it is returned.

### Syntax

`BasicState.new([ InitialState: Dictionary<any, any> = {} ]): State`

## `State:Set()`

---

Sets the value of a given key in the state, and then fires off any `Changed` signals. You should always use this when you need to change the state. Use `:RawSet()` to change values without invoking change events.

### Syntax

`State:Set(Key: any, Value: any): void`

## `State:SetState()`

---

Set multiple values in the state. `Changed` signals will be fired for each modified key.

### Syntax

`State:SetState(StateTable: Dictionary<any, any>): void`
`State:SetState(Callback: (State: Dictionary<any, any>) -> Dictionary<any, any>): void`

### Example

```lua
local State = BasicState.new({
    Location = "Mountain",
    Greetings = {
        Place = "Welcome to the Mountain!",
        Roblox = "Hey Roblox!",
        Me = "Hi csqrl!"
    }
})

State:SetState({
    Location = "City",
    Greetings = {
        Place = "Welcome to the City!"
    }
})

--[[
    The new state object will look like this:

    {
        Location = "City",
        Greetings = {
            Place = "Welcome to the City!",
            Roblox = "Hey Roblox!",
            Me = "Hi csqrl!"
        }
    }
--]]
```

## `State:Reset()`

---

Resets state back to its initial keys/values.

### Syntax

`State:Reset(): void`

## `State:Delete()`

---

Deletes a key from the store by setting its value to `State.None` (internally converted to `nil`).

### Syntax

`State:Delete(Key: any): void`

### Example

```lua
local State = BasicState.new({
    Hello = "World"
})

State:Delete("Hello")

print(State:Get("Hello")) --> nil
```

## `State:Toggle()`

---

Toggles a stored Boolean value between `true` and `false`. Will throw an error if the stored value is not a Boolean.

### Syntax

`State:Toggle(Key: any): void`

### Example

```lua
local State = BasicState.new({
    MenuOpen = false
})

State:Toggle("MenuOpen") --> true
State:Toggle("MenuOpen") --> false
```

## `State:Increment()`

---

Increases the value of a stored numeric value by 1 (or a specified amount), with an optional cap parameter, which will stop incrementing above a specified number. Will throw an error is the stored value is not a number.

### Syntax

`State:Increment(Key: any[, Amount: Number = 1][, Cap: Number = nil]): void`

## `State:Decrement()`

---

Decreases the value of a stored numeric value by 1 (or a specified amount), with an optional cap parameter, which will stop decrementing below a specified number. Will throw an error if the stored value is not a number.

### Syntax

`State:Decrement(Key: any[, Amount: Number = 1][, Cap: Number = nil]): void`

### Example

```lua
local State = BasicState.new({
    Money = 100
})

local function BuyItem(ItemName, ItemPrice)
    -- A cap of 0 was specified to prevent Money from going below 0
    State:Decrement("Money", ItemPrice, 0)
    print(string.format("Bought %s for %d", ItemName, ItemPrice))
end

BuyItem("Noodles", 12)
```

## `State:RawSet()`

---

Sets a value in the store without firing any `.Changed` (or `:GetChangedSignal`) events. `:RawSet()` will also ignore the value of `ProtectType`, so be careful when dealing with type-sensitive data.

### Syntax

`State:RawSet(Key: any, Value: any): void`

## `State:Get()`

---

Retrieves a value stored in the state. If `DefaultValue` is specified, it will return that if the entry does not exist (or is equal to `nil`).

### Syntax

`State:Get(Key: any[, DefaultValue: any = nil]): any`

## `State:GetState()`

---

Returns the full state object. A new table is returned, rather than a reference to the internal state object. This prevents directly overwriting the state. You should always use the `:Set()` method if you wish to mutate state.

### Syntax

`State:GetState(): Dictionary<any, any>`

## `State:GetChangedSignal()`

---

Returns an [RBXScriptSignal](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/RBXScriptSignal) which is only fired when the value of the specified key is updated. The Event fires with the following values (in order):

| Name       | Type                   | Description                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `NewValue` | `any`                  | The new value of the requested entry.      |
| `OldValue` | `any`                  | The value of the entry prior to mutation.  |
| `OldState` | `Dictionary<any, any>` | The entire state object prior to mutation. |

### Syntax

`State:GetChangedSignal(Key: any): RBXScriptSignal`

### Example

```lua
local State = BasicState.new({
    Hello = "World"
})

State:GetChangedSignal("Hello"):Connect(function(NewValue, OldValue, OldState)
    print(OldValue) --> "World"
    print(NewValue) --> "Roblox"
end)

State:Set("Hello", "Roblox")
```

## `State:Destroy()`

---

Clears the current state and disconnects all connections.

### Syntax

`State:Destroy(): void`

## `State:Roact()`

---

Wraps a Roact component and injects BasicState into the component's state.

!!! tip "Experimental"

    This feature is experimental! You may encounter bugs when using it; if so, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/csqrl/BasicState/issues/new).

### Syntax

`State:Roact(Component: Roact.Component[, Keys: any[] = nil]): Roact.Component`

### Example

There's a full example within the `/examples` directory on how to use BasicState with Roact: [`examples/roact-wrapped-counter`](https://github.com/csqrl/BasicState/tree/default/examples/roact-wrapped-counter).

## `State.Changed`

---

An [RBXScriptSignal](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/datatype/RBXScriptSignal) which is fired any time the state mutates. The Event fires with the following values (in order):

!!! warning

    Using `:GetChangedSignal()` is the preferred method for listening to state changes.

| Name       | Type                   | Description                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `OldState` | `Dictionary<any, any>` | The entire state object prior to mutation. |
| `Key`      | `any`                  | The key of the entry which has mutated.    |

### Syntax

`State.Changed: RBXScriptSignal`

### Example

```lua
local State = BasicState.new({
    Hello = "World"
})

State.Changed:Connect(function(OldState, Key)
    print(Key) --> "Hello"
    print(OldState[Key]) --> "World"
    print(State:Get(Key)) --> "Roblox"
end)

State:Set("Hello", "Roblox")
```

## `State.ProtectType`

---

A boolean value which determines whether strict type-checking is enabled on the state table. This prevents changing the type of stored data, e.g. from a number to a string. This is **disabled** by default.

To enable type-safety, simply set this property to true after initialising a new BasicState instance: `State.ProtectType = true`.

Using `:RawSet()` will ignore type-checking.

### Syntax

`State.ProtectType: boolean`

### Example

```lua
local State = BasicState.new({
    Hello = "World"
})

State.ProtectType = true
State:Set("Hello", 1234) --> Will throw an error: A string was expected, but it received a number.
```

## `State.None`

---

Lua is unable to determine whether a value in a table is `nil` or `undefined`, and removes `nil` values from tables as a result. `State.None` is designed to stand in to enable you to remove keys from the state object, which was previously impossible without. It can be used directly with `:Set`, `:SetState` or `:RawSet`, or by using `:Delete` to remove a single key.

### Syntax

`State.None: userdata`

### Example

```lua
State:Delete("Hello")
```

```lua
State:SetState({
    Hello = State.None,
})
```
